== Introduction ==
GladesAI transforms how artificial intelligence is developed and applied in financial markets. Our goal is to democratize advanced AI tools while ensuring developers maintain ownership of the models they create. Through our specialized AI engine, users can build, customize, and deploy sophisticated trading and analysis solutions that traditionally were only available to large financial institutions.

We've created an ecosystem where developing finance AI tools becomes accessible and rewarding. Whether you're collaborating with colleagues on trading algorithms or using our gamified system to train market analysis models, GladesAI provides the infrastructure to make AI development profitable. Our platform integrates seamlessly across multiple channels - from standard programming languages like C++ and Python to popular platforms like Discord and Telegram, enabling widespread deployment of financial AI solutions.

The future of AI in finance should be open to all. Through the GladesAI marketplace, developers can share their algorithms, license their analysis models, or sell their financial AI solutions outright. We're building more than a platform - we're creating a community where financial innovation is rewarded and creators maintain control of their intellectual property.

== About GladesAI ==
GladesAI is a technological research company focused on financial AI development. While most current AI solutions in finance rely on black-box models or repackaged ChatGPT implementations, we develop our own mathematical models and AI algorithms specifically designed for market analysis, portfolio optimization, and trading strategies.

We believe in open-source development and provide free financial analysis tools and services that users can implement immediately. Our platform enables anyone to create custom AI models for market analysis from scratch, with full control over the training process. Users can run these models locally on their own hardware, ensuring their trading strategies and financial data remain private and secure.

GladesAI gives financial developers and AI creators the freedom to build sophisticated market analysis tools without compromise. From processing market data to developing automated trading systems, our platform provides the foundation for independent financial AI development while keeping creators in control of their innovations.

== Team ==
=== Lead Developer - Robert Caneiro ===
Robert brings nearly two decades of programming expertise to GladesAI, beginning with MIPS subroutines before mastering C and C++. His passion for mathematics and finance led him to develop sophisticated stock analysis systems, which evolved into the foundation of the Glades engine. After serving as a software engineer at FactSet where he worked on their screening engine, Robert transitioned to DeFi full-time and now dedicates his efforts entirely to advancing the GladesAI project.

=== Product Development - Daniel Brewster ===
Daniel combines ten years of investment experience in stocks and commodities with strong quantitative research skills and Python programming knowledge. His recent focus on artificial intelligence and neural networks allows him to bridge the gap between traditional investment strategies and emerging AI technologies. Daniel's ongoing exploration of AI applications in financial markets brings valuable insights to the project's development.

=== Infrastructure Lead - Matthew Carleson ===
Matthew's eight years of software development experience spans machine-oriented programming and virtual reality game development. His proficiency in C++, Go, Python, and web development has been instrumental in building the Glades Engine infrastructure. Matthew applies his expertise in game theory and practical applications to create innovative tools for stock and crypto ecosystems, helping shape the future of financial technology.

== Technology ==
At the core of GladesAI lies our implementation of Deep Learning through Feed Forward Neural Networks. While these neural networks form the foundation of many modern AI systems including large language models like ChatGPT, we have optimized our implementation specifically for financial analysis and market applications.

=== Core Libraries ===
Our technology stack is built on three primary open-source C++ libraries:
{| class="wikitable"
! Library !! Purpose
|-
| ShmeaDB || Core Database Management
|-
| GladesAI || Neural Network Engine
|-
| GFXplusplus || Graphics and Visualization
|}

These libraries are designed with minimal dependencies to ensure maximum portability and efficiency. This architecture allows our system to run seamlessly on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments, giving users the flexibility to deploy models locally on their own hardware.

The GladesAI engine processes complex financial data through sophisticated neural network analysis. Users can access our technology through multiple channels:
* Direct integration with our open-source C++ libraries
* Web API access for remote deployments
* Communication platform bots for easy monitoring
* Planned web interface for working with personal datasets

Our current free public demo provides access to our basic AI features and analysis tools. Future development will introduce both free and premium tiers, expanding the platform's capabilities while maintaining accessibility for all users. The upcoming web interface will simplify the process of training models on personal datasets, further democratizing access to sophisticated financial AI technology.

== Business Model ==
=== Revenue Strategy ===
GladesAI's revenue strategy combines immediate monetization opportunities with long-term value creation for token holders. Our business model is built on multiple revenue streams that support sustainable growth while maintaining accessibility for users.

==== Revenue Streams ====
'''Platform Fees'''
* Verification and listing fees for new models on our marketplace
* Usage-based pricing for specific services (per scan, per check)
* Access fees for premium data sets and specialized directories

'''Subscription Services'''
* Tiered subscription models for specialized tools and advanced features
* Bot subscriptions for automated trading and analysis services
* Seat-based pricing for team collaboration tools

'''Additional Revenue Sources'''
* Commission fees on model sales through our exchange
* Strategic, non-intrusive advertising on selected products and websites

=== Growth Strategy ===
During our growth phase, we are prioritizing reinvestment of revenue into key areas:
* Expanding our development team
* Strategic marketing initiatives
* Platform enhancement and feature development
* Market expansion and user acquisition

=== Long-term Value Creation ===
Our long-term strategy focuses on increasing token holder value through:
* Regular token buybacks from revenue
* Strategic token burns to manage supply
* Continuous platform development to drive utility and demand

== Tokenomics ==
The GLDS token is designed with simplicity and sustainability in mind. Rather than implementing complex tokenomics mechanisms, we focus on creating genuine utility and value through our AI ecosystem.

=== Token Fundamentals ===
{| class="wikitable"
! Metric !! Value
|-
| Total Supply || 100,000,000 GLDS
|}

=== Token Distribution ===
{| class="wikitable"
! Category !! Amount !! Percentage
|-
| Public Distribution || 80,000,000 GLDS || 80%
|-
| Team Allocation || 10,000,000 GLDS || 10%
|-
| Partnership Reserve || 5,000,000 GLDS || 5%
|-
| Exchange Listings || 5,000,000 GLDS || 5%
|}

=== Token Utility ===
* Access to premium platform features
* Participation in model marketplace transactions
* Future staking rewards with enhanced platform capabilities
* Governance participation in platform development

=== Revenue Model ===
We maintain a straightforward approach to token economics:
* Purchase taxes directly support business operations and development
* Business profits fund token buybacks and burns, reducing supply over time
* Staking mechanisms will be introduced to reward long-term holders
* Integration of the token throughout our growing ecosystem

Through this simplified approach, we aim to create lasting value for token holders while maintaining the resources needed for continued platform development and growth.
